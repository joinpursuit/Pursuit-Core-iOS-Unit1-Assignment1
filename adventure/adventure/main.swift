 Title: A Different Kind of Adventure
 
 Conceptually, the idea is to go through an ordinary day. However, the focus will be less on what you do when you are alone, and more on how you choose to interact with the people you come into contact with and how they affect your mood / energy levels. Below is a list of ideas for who we will be interacting with:
 
    - Nosy Neighbor
    - Best friend
    - Parent
    - Stranger
    - Some manner of store employee
    - Pet
    - Sibling
    - Co-worker
    - Partner
    - One's self
    
 
 Interactions can take the form of phone calls, texts, video chats, in person exchanges, and body language exchanges/implied feelings.
 
 Toying with the idea of keeping track of exhaustion, or energy reserves and making a win condition be something like getting home without thoroughly exhausting yourself. We'll make it so that if your exhaustion reaches too high a level, you will be forceably returned home without being able to accomplish any other task. How deftly, or clumsily you navigate the exchanges will result in how much energy is expended. Although your choices will be considered in energy exhaustion, they will not be able to negate the expenditure of energy. EVERY INTERACTION WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING WILL RESULT IN LOST ENERGY. Your choices will affect HOW MUCH energy is expendid. For the sake of simplicity, any given exchange will expend a variable amount of energy, and a variable amount of energy minimum given how well you handle the situation. Again, for the sake of simplicity, we'll limit our interactions to 10, and make it so that each interaction allows you three different choices to make. The end result of each exchange can be a value that will be subtracted from your total energy.
 
 Ten Functions, each handling a specific encounter.
 
 If you energy depletes to 0, you will be robbed of your ability to make good choices.
 
 Must tweak values. Should only be allowed to deplete to 0 before lunch.

        It is morning. You wake up feeling disoriented, but not unrested. You begin to wonder what happened to the alarm you set for this morning. You reach for your phone and discover that you woke up four minutes before your alarm is set go off. You take a minute to consider going to back to sleep, but decide that four minutes will change absolutely nothing. You toggle off your alarm and head to the restroom. After doing all of the things you usually do in the restroom, you have a breakfast of your favourite cereal with a friuit of your choice. After washing your dishes, you begin to head out for the day when you hear a low whine. You look down and notice your dog staring up at you with eyes that say, "If you do not walk me now, you can expect to come home to a soiled floor." You don't speak dog, but that is what you imagine her eyes to be saying. You stop for a minute to think it over. What do you do:

The idea is to explore as many different outcomes as you can, while managing your energy efficiently. The more involved you are with someone, or something, the more energy you'll expend.

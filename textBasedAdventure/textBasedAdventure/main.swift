/* I originally created a text-based adventure that did not make much logical sense, so I redid this project and decided to create something more meaningful. My mom, who is my sponsor for the Pursuit program, is the manager and cashier at a buffet restaurant. When I decided to apply for Pursuit, she asked me if I can create an app to enable customers to pay at a kiosk upon entrance by themselves so that she no longer needs to cashier behind the register. I asked her for the current prices for lunch and dinner, adult and kids, and the beverages. */
